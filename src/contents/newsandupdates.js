      headline: ' Typhoon Odette Housing Project in Bayagnan Island, Surigao City',
      description: 'In December 2021, the country was again struck by a super typhoon that left many of our countrymen devastated and homeless. One of the most affected areas was Surigao Province, particularly the island communities of Surigao City. Since communication and electricity were down, it took us days to learn about the situation on Bayagnan Island, where we do our mission and apostolate. But despite the tough situation after the typhoon, the MSC, through the efforts of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage Parish and other MSC mission partners, was still able to conduct numerous relief operations in the affected communities in Surigao. On March 23, 2022, the MSC Typhoon Odette Housing Project started. And with the help of our community leaders, who dedicated their time and effort, the implementation of the project was right on schedule. And finally, two months after the construction began, on May 25, 2022, the 129 newly constructed houses were blessed by Msgr. Edito Alcala, DCS, together with the MSC Surigao District fathers. The families are so grateful for the help and support that the MSC fathers have given them. They promised that they would take good care of their new home, and they also hope and pray that God will continuously bless us so that we can be able to bless others. ',
